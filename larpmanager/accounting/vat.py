    """Compute VAT for a payment based on ticket and options VAT rates.

    Calculates VAT for an accounting item payment by splitting the payment
    between ticket amount and options, applying different VAT rates to each.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Validates that VAT feature is enabled and payment is in money
    2. Calculates previous payments to determine remaining amounts
    3. Retrieves VAT configuration for tickets and options
    4. Splits current payment between ticket and options portions
    5. Updates the payment record with calculated VAT amounts

    Args:
        instance: AccountingItemPayment instance to compute VAT for.
                 Must have valid association_id, pay type, registration, and inv attributes.

    Returns:
        None: Function modifies the instance's VAT fields in the database as a side effect.

    Side Effects:
        Updates the instance's vat_ticket and vat_options fields in the database.
