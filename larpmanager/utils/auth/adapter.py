    The OAuth provider callback is only ever reached on the main domain (Google's
    redirect URI is registered there, not per-subdomain), so `request.association`
    is always the main-domain association at this point - it cannot be used here to
    detect the subdomain the login started from. That information instead travels
    through the 'next' parameter, set server-side by `get_social_login_url` in
    show_tags.py, pointing to: /after_login/{slug}/

    The callback request itself carries no 'next' (allauth keeps it in its session
    state), so the slug stashed by SocialLoginTargetMiddleware is used as fallback
    whenever that state was lost.
