"""Confirmation interstitial for state-changing endpoints reached via GET links.

Several action endpoints (approve/confirm/delete/toggle) are linked from
templates as plain GET anchors, which makes them triggerable by CSRF
(``<img src>``, prefetch, link-unfurl). Wrapping the view with
``confirm_post`` turns the GET into a harmless confirmation page whose only
action is a same-origin, CSRF-token-protected POST back to the same URL; the
wrapped view body only runs on that POST.
