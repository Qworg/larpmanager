    """Assign number to FAQ if not already set.

    Automatically assigns a sequential number to an FAQ item based on its type.
    Numbers are assigned in increments of 10 (10, 20, 30, etc.) to allow for
    future insertions between existing items.

    Args:
        faq (LarpManagerFaq): FAQ instance to assign number to. Must have a 'typ'
            attribute to determine the sequence group.

    Returns:
        None: This function modifies the FAQ object in place.

    Note:
        If the FAQ already has a number assigned, no action is taken.
        The numbering starts at 1 for the first FAQ of each type.
