## Quick start (Docker)

If you want an easy and fast deploy, set the environment variables see below for [instructions](#environment) on their values:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Now time for the docker magic (see below for [instructions](#docker) on installing it):

```
docker compose up --build
```

Now create a super user:

```
docker exec -it larpmanager python manage.py createsuperuser
```

> **Security recommendation**: It is strongly recommended to enable two-factor authentication (TOTP) for all superuser and staff accounts on the Django admin backend (`/admin/`). After your first login, go to **Home / OTP TOTP devices** in the admin panel and configure a TOTP device using an authenticator app (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy, Bitwarden). Once a device is enrolled, the next admin login will require OTP verification.

Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8264/admin/larpmanager/association/`, and create your Organization. Put as values only:
- Name: you should get it;
- URL identifier: put `def`;
- Logo: an image;
- Main mail: the main mail of the organization (duh)

Leave the other fields empty, and save.

Now expose the port 8264 (we wanted a fancy one) to your reverse proxy of choice for public access. Example configuration for nginx, place this code in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com`:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8264;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Now create the symlink:

```
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

Now you're ready for liftoff!

---

*Windows user*: On some cases the docker fails to start up, you might want to try

```
dos2unix scripts/entrypoint.sh
```

---

If you want some more extra juicy stuff, you can set an automatic execution of

```
docker exec -it larpmanager python manage.py automate
```

This command performs a bunch of stuff related to advanced features; it should be run each day (cron?), when low traffic is expected (night?). You _should_ combine it with the daily backup of `pgdata` and `media_data` volumes.

---

In the future, if you want to pull the latest changes of the repo, go with:

```
git pull origin main
docker exec -it larpmanager scripts/deploy.sh
```

It will perform a graceful restart.

### Cloud recommendations

Suggested baseline for cloud VMs:
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (required for Python 3.12)
- Instance type: burstable instance to handle activity spikes
-
Some typical options could be:
- EC2: t3.small / t3.medium
- GCP: e2-small / e2-medium
- Azure: B1ms / B2s

---

### Environment variables

Set those values:
- GUNICORN_WORKERS: Rule of thumb is number of processors * 2 + 1
- SECRET_KEY: A fresh secret key, you can use an [online tool](https://djecrety.ir/)
- ADMIN_NAME, ADMIN_EMAIL: Set your own info
- DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_HOST: The database will be generated based on those values if it does not exists
- TZ: The base timezone of the server
- GOOGLE_CLIENTID, GOOGLE_SECRET: (Optional) If you want Google SSO, follow the [django-allauth guide](https://docs.allauth.org/en/dev/socialaccount/providers/google.html)
- RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC, RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE: If you want recaptcha checks, follow the [django-recaptcha guide](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/recaptcha)

---

### Docker installation

To install everything needed for the quick setup, install some dependencies:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

add docker's repo:

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

finally, install Docker:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

run it:

```
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

## Portainer deployment

[Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) lets you deploy and manage the stack through a web UI instead of the CLI.

### Prerequisites

Portainer must already be installed and running. If not, follow the
[official install guide](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install-ce/server/docker/linux).

### Deploy the stack

1. In Portainer, go to **Stacks -> Add stack**
2. Name it `larpmanager`
3. Choose **Repository** and point it to your local clone of this repo, or use **Web editor** and paste the contents of `docker-compose.yml`
4. Scroll down to **Environment variables** and add the values listed in `.env.example` (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables) for descriptions)
5. Click **Deploy the stack**

Portainer pulls images, builds the app container, and starts all services.

### First-time setup

Once the stack is running, open a console into the app container:

1. Portainer -> **Containers** -> click `larpmanager` -> **Console** -> **Connect**
2. Run:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

3. Browse to `http://your-server-ip:8264/admin/larpmanager/association/` and create your organization (Name, URL identifier `def`, Logo, Main mail -- leave everything else empty).

### Verify everything is working

- **App responds**: browse to `http://your-server-ip:8264/` -- you should see the LarpManager login page
- **Admin works**: browse to `http://your-server-ip:8264/admin/` and log in with the superuser you created
- **Static files load**: CSS and images render correctly (served by nginx via the `static_data` volume)
- **Media uploads work**: upload a logo in the association admin; it should save without errors

### Expose on a specific IP or change the port

By default nginx binds port 8264 on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`). To restrict to a specific IP, edit the `nginx` ports line in the stack editor:

```yaml
nginx:
  ports:
    - "192.168.1.50:8264:80"   # only this IP accepts connections
```

Replace `192.168.1.50` with your server's LAN or public IP. To use a different host port, change the first number (e.g. `"80:80"`).

### Use a reverse proxy for a domain name

To serve on a domain with standard ports (80/443), run a reverse proxy as a separate Portainer stack (nginx, Traefik, Caddy, etc.). Example minimal nginx config:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8264;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

With this in place, remove the `ports` section from the `nginx` service in the LarpManager stack so it is no longer exposed directly.

### Day-to-day operations via Portainer

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| View logs | Containers -> `larpmanager` -> Logs |
| Run management commands | Containers -> `larpmanager` -> Console |
| Update to latest code | Pull repo on host, then Console: `scripts/deploy.sh` |
| Daily automation | Console: `python manage.py automate` (schedule via host cron or Portainer scheduled jobs) |
| Backup data | Volumes -> download `pgdata` and `media_data` |

## Local Setup

The typical, recommended setup is to have:
* On a server the *production* instance, managed with docker, with the real user data, CI pipeline, automated backup and all other devops best practices;
* On your local machine, a *development* instance, managed with dedicated system installations, dummy test database and local development server.

Here are the step for a local setup on your machine, required for both *Develop* and *Contributing*.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS recommended

For a Debian-like system: install the following packages:

```bash
# On Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3.12-dev python3-pip redis-server git \
  postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev nodejs build-essential libxmlsec1-dev \
  libxmlsec1-openssl libcairo2-dev pkg-config

# On Ubuntu 22.04 or older (requires deadsnakes PPA for Python 3.12)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3.12-dev python3-pip redis-server git \
  postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev nodejs build-essential libxmlsec1-dev \
  libxmlsec1-openssl libcairo2-dev pkg-config
```

Install uv (fast Python package manager):
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

Install and activate LFS to handle big files:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install git-lfs
   git lfs install
   git lfs pull
   ```

### Database Setup

Create the PostgreSQL database and user:
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Then run the following SQL commands (default credentials: user `larpmanager`, password `larpmanager`):
```sql
CREATE DATABASE larpmanager;
CREATE USER larpmanager WITH PASSWORD 'larpmanager';
ALTER USER larpmanager CREATEDB;  -- Required for running tests
ALTER DATABASE larpmanager OWNER TO larpmanager;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE larpmanager TO larpmanager;
\q
```

**Note:** The `CREATEDB` privilege is required for running tests, as pytest creates temporary test databases.

### Django Configuration

1. Copy `main/settings/dev_sample.py` to `main/settings/dev.py`:
   ```bash
   cp main/settings/dev_sample.py main/settings/dev.py
   ```

2. The default database settings should work with the setup above. If you used different credentials, update the `DATABASES` section in `main/settings/dev.py`.

3. In `SLUG_ASSOC`, put the slug of the organization that will be loaded (default is `def`).


### Frontend Dependencies

Install npm modules for frontend functionality:
```bash
cd larpmanager/static
npm install
cd ../..
```

### Testing Setup

Install Playwright browsers for end-to-end tests:
```bash
playwright install
```


## Develop

The codebase is based on Django; if you're not already familiar with it, we highly suggest you to follow the tutorials at https://docs.djangoproject.com/.

1. Follow the steps outlined in [Local setup](#local-setup) for setting up your local *development* instance

2. Run migrations to initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Load the initial test data:
   ```bash
   python manage.py reset
   ```

(Since this command is dangerous, we added a check to prevent it to be executed on `main` branch; to execute, just create a new branch before)

4. Now you can run the local server for manual testing and debugging:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

5. You can use default users "orga@test.it" and "user@test.it", both with password "banana"

## Contributing

Thanks in advance for contributing! Here's the steps:

1. Follow the steps outlined in [Local setup](#local-setup) for setting up your local *development* instance

2. Install and activate `pre-commit`:
   ```bash
   uv pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. In the `main/settings/dev.py` settings file, add a `DEEPL_API_KEY` value. You can obtain a API key for the *DeepL API Free* (up to 500k characters monthly) [here](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro).

4. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b prefix/feature-name
   ```
   For the prefix please follow this naming strategy:
   - *hotfix* for urgent fixes in production
   - *fix* for correction to existing functions
   - *feature* for introducing / upgrading functions
   - *refactor* for code changes not related to functions
   - *locale* for changes in translation codes.

5. When you'are ready with the code changes, to make sure that all entries have been translated (default language is English), run
   ```bash
   ./scripts/translate.sh
   ```
   This will updated all your translations, have correct the untranslated / fuzzy ones with Deepl API. In the terminal, take some time to review them before proceeding.
6. If you're creating a new feature, write a playwright test suite that covers it. Look in the `larpmanager/tests` folder to see how it's done. (Standard users are "orga@test.it" and "user@test.it", both with password "banana"). Run
   ```bash
   ./scripts/record-test.sh
   ```
   To run an instance of playwright that will record all your actions, in code that can later be inserted into the test.
   - If you wish to expand an existing test, you can place a `page.pause()` at the end of it, and then run
   ```bash
    PWDEBUG=1 pytest larpmanager/tests/playwright/ability_px_test.py --headed -s
    ```
   It will execute the text up untile the pause, so you can record the actions after it (remember to remove the `page.pause()` before committing)
7. If you're changing the model or the fixtures, run:
   ```bash
   python manage.py dump_test
   ```
   to update the dump used by tests and ci.
8. Before pushing make sure that all the tests passes using:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test.sh [workers] (default: 4 workers)
   ```
   *Note that the tests will take some time to complete*.
9. When you're ready to push your new branch, run
   ```bash
   ./scripts/upgrade.sh
   ```
   This will execute some helpful activities like making sure you're updated with main branch, deleting old local branches, and other small things like that.

10. Go and open [a new pull request](https://github.com/loskana/larpmanager/pulls). Make sure to explain clearly in the description what's happening.


### Guidelines

Pull Requests should include **only the minimal changes necessary** to achieve their goal.
Avoid non-essential changes such as refactoring, renaming, or reformatting, **unless explicitly approved beforehand**.

This helps keep code reviews focused, reduces merge conflicts, and maintains a clean commit history.
If you believe a refactor is needed, please open an issue or start a discussion first to get approval.
